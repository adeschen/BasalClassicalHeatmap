Title: Heatmap using basal-like and classical gene list and RNA-seq expression 
    data 
Description: This package enables Basal-like/Classical classification of 
    pancreatic tumor samples by generating a heatmap. There is three different 
    lists of genes available in the package: the original list from Moffitt et 
    al. 2015; the updated list from Miyabayashi et al. 2020 and the list from 
    Tiriac et al. 2018 that has been developed for pancreatic ductal 
    adenocarcinoma (PDAC) organoids.
